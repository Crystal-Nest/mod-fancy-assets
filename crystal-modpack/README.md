## **Description**
Light Vanilla+ Modpack working both standalone or coupled with the provided server pack version (Crystal Server).  
Play a Vanilla style modpack, but improved in many ways.

## **Included mods**
Check the [Relations tab](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/crystal-modpack/relations/dependencies).

## **Optifine**
This modpack (client side only) needs Optifine to work properly.  
To install and download the latest Optifine version follow these steps:
- Go to https://www.optifine.net/downloads and download the OptiFine HD U H7 for Minecraft 1.18.2 (you will need to click on "Show all versions" to see it).

  ![Optifine download 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyphet/mod-fancy-assets/main/crystal-modpack/optifine-h7.png)
- Go to your CurseForge profile and select the option to open the folder of this modpack.  
  ![Curseforge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyphet/mod-fancy-assets/main/crystal-modpack/curseforge-open-folder.png)
- Open the subfolder `mods` and drag there the `OptiFine_1.18.2_HD_U_H7.jar`.

## **Configuration**
This modpack, both client/standalone and server, is already configured and no further configuration is needed.  
However if you wish to change video settings or controls feel free to do so.

In case you want to play using also the server pack, the server entry will already be present once the game opens, however it must be edited to point to the right IP address of your choice.

If you need help on how to setup your own server, for free and without 3rd party software, just ask in the comments and I'll be glad to help.
